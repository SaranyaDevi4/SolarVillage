# Solar Village
This project is developed using Process Automation Engine 7 (PAM7) where we can send and process the order request, get the approval from government Agencies and complete the request.
## Main features:
-	Process the new order request
-	Get Approval from HOA (using human task i.e.,we can claim the task by using an admin role)
-	After approval,parallel process will happen to send and persists permit requests(webservices developed using spring-boot.The webservice process also contains the service to check the database for any of the pending task and approve that.)
-	If approved,the process will be completed.
-	If denied,the rollback of data will happen.
## Prereqs:
-	Java
-	Maven
-	PAM7 with kie server
-	Oracle database
-	Springboot project(GovernmentPermit)
## Installation:
-	Install PAM7 and kie server ( I have a JBPM)
-	Configure database with following details(for springboot project)(change the configuration as you need in application-properties)

* **url**     :  jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
* **username**: test_database
* **password**: asdf123

-	clone the repo for SolarVillage Project and clone the repo for [GovernmentPermit](https://github.com/SaranyaDevi4/GovermentPermit).
-	Build and deploy the SolarVillage project with kie-container creation)
-	Build the Government Permit project and start using
-	Java â€“jar GovernmentPermit.jar  (or) mvn spring-boot:run
## Test the project:
-	If you use the container name with the same name of the project GAV, (i.e SolarVillage_3.0.13) you will be able to see in Business Central, all the process instances and tasks created created by Kie Server.
## Kie Server REST API:
-	Headers to use with POST and PUT (Auth required, you can use i.e JBPM user): Accept:application/json Content-Type:application/json
